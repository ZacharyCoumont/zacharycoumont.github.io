    <p>I'm Zachary Coumont, a web and iOS developer with a passion for building interactive and unique applications. After first discovering the world of programming over fourteen years ago, I taught myself various computer-based languages, with a focus on the web. To further my knowledge, I took on small jobs in a variety of programming languages, making many types of programs ranging from content management systems to games. Fresh out of high school, I enrolled in the New Media Design &amp; Web Development program at British Columbia Institute of Technology to become a more well-rounded member of online society, supplementing my programming background with knowledge of design, marketing, and business.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working on the latest and greatest website or application, I spend time creating experimental programming projects or building digital empires in various games. I also enjoy taking the occasional break to travel the world.</p>
